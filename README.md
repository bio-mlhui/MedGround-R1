This is the official implmentation of MedGround-R1, which incorporates **[GRPO](https://github.com/bio-mlhui/MedGround-R1/blob/ccf28f21f474a60bfcdeb9883a60586a7f3b6c6a/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/trainer/grpo_trainer.py#L359)** and **[ MedCLIP semantic reward](https://github.com/bio-mlhui/MedGround-R1/blob/ccf28f21f474a60bfcdeb9883a60586a7f3b6c6a/open-r1-multimodal/src/open_r1/grpo_rec.py#L236)**. Without any cold start sft or cot annotation, MedGroud-R1 achieves sota on three public medical grounding benchmarks.

## TIMELINE (Updating)

- [x] 09/24 upload dataset and log for MS-CXR 
- [x] 09/01 miccai'25 **best paper shortlist** ðŸ˜Š 
- [x] 08/10 miccai'25 splotlight
- [x] 07/01 camera ready paper upload to arxiv 
- [x] 05/10 miccai'25 early accept 

## Announcement
The author is committed to fully open-access and transparency, all checkpoints will be uploaded before 10/08 holiday. 

## Items
1. Installation for VLM-R1: Our repo is based on VLM-R1, please refer to [vlm-r1](https://github.com/om-ai-lab/VLM-R1) for installation guidance.
2. Installation for MedCLIP: Please refer to [medclip](https://github.com/RyanWangZf/MedCLIP) for installation guidance. 

3. Training: 
Using 8 H100 80G:
```
cd open-r1-multimodal/src/open-r1
bash run_grpo_rec.sh
```

4. Evaluate:
```
python eval/test_rec_r1_med_qwen25.py
```

5. logs, checkpoints, predictions
